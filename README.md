distancecalculator
==================

Calculates the "detour distance" between two drivers.

Assumes there are two drivers with distinct start and end points (latitude/longitude), one of whom must pick up the other driver AND complete the other driver's route before completing their own trip. Given all the initial latitude/longitude pairs, the calculator will tell you which driver has the shorter detour distance and what the distance is.
